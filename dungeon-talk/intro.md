Just over a year ago, I left management and went back into engineering.

And I've had the absolute pleasure of once again working with people who are earlier on in their careers than I am, and what we talk about a lot - or I talk at them about a lot - is how to approach programming.

I don't know if I'd dare call myself a craftsman, I'm more of an experienced janitor who mutters to himself while he's cleaning the corridors, but nonetheless, we talk about how to practically approach problems.

Problems that you don't know how to solve, yet. Problems that are overwhelming and outside of your comfort zone.

And I thought I'd try and share a bit of that by relating a piece of work I did not so long ago.

My hope is that those of you who are new to all this will maybe pick up a few process pointers, ...and that I can keep the rest of you awake with some weird stuff you probably haven't seen a Scala talk on before.

So!

How to build a Dungeon.

One of the biggest mistakes I regularly make, is trying to do too much at once.
